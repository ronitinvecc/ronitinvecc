- 👋 Hi, I’m @ronitinvecc undergrad at IIT Kharagpur pursuing a masters degree in Physics.
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep learning, Quantum Computing and Particle Physics (Detectors, Analysis and Simulation).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning QML, Particle Physics.
- 👨‍💻 I hope to pursue a PhD in experimental Physics but I still haven't yet narrowed down the field. Currently exploring the aforementioned subjects and wondering what my heart will call for to settle down with.
- 👨‍💻 I have working expeirence with detector simulation and analysis and I have worked on several projects of eep learning, Sentiment Analysis, Image Processing and Reinforcement learning.
- 👨‍💻 I am also keen participant in Quantum Computing hackathons, contact me if you would want to team up. Let
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Deep learning projects especially aiding Physics (visualization ,simulation, monte carlo methods, analysis and optimization)
- 📫 You can contact me via my institute mail id - ronit.dutta@kgpian.iitkgp.ac.in
